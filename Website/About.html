        Google prioritizes environmental sustainability through various initiatives. Since achieving carbon neutrality in 2007, Google has continued to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The company invests in renewable energy projects, such as wind farms and solar panels, to power 100% of its operations. Google's data centers utilize advanced cooling systems and efficient servers to minimize energy consumption. Additionally, the company focuses on water conservation and waste reduction, recycling or reusing 85% of its waste.

Google's environmental impact is significant, with approximately 1.5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions annually. The company consumes around 2.3 billion gallons of water and uses 4.4 billion kWh of electricity annually. To mitigate this, Google partners with organizations like The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and Environmental Defense Fund.
